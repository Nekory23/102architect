# 102architect

{EPITECH} | First year | Math project 

You are working on a homeplanning software for an architecture firm.
The goal is to simplify the process of drawing the plan, and to integrate various features such as scale management, 
changing the point of view, moving doors and windows along walls...
You are in charge of implementing the geometric transformations (rotation to change point of view,
translation to move an object, scaling to zoom in and out, reflection and any combination of these transformations).

You need to develop a program to compute the coordinates of a point after several transformations.
To make it nice and clean, you chose to use homogeneous coordinates.
0 being the origin of both axis, here are the transformations to be implemented:

- Translation
- Scaling
- Rotation centered at 0
- Reflection over any axis that passes through 0,
- Any combination of the previous transformations.

See the subject for further details !
